# The Mintbean Community

## Welcome!

Thank you for joining us today in our hackathon! We're so excited to have you here. Mintbean is more than a series of hackathons -- we are a community, and we're constantly building new bridges for software developers to get ahead in their careers.

These short-format hackathons are the heart of our community. They're 4-hour "bursts" that are designed to make it easier for you to find a job and get ahead in your career. 

## How Mintbean strengthens your portfolio

The basic formula here is: `Strength of portfolio = Quantity + Visibility`

The more projects you build and the more you post to social media, the more attractive you are to potential employers. 

Regularly attending both the Monday and the Wednesday hackathons is a great way to boost your portfolio and your social media visibility, making you extremely marketable to employers.

This hackathon's goal is to help you:

1. **Build** your portfolio to make your job application more impressive to employers.
2. **Showcase** your projects on social media (LinkedIn and Twitter)
3. **Repeat**. We do these hackathons 2x a week as a community.

## Schedule

* 12pm-4pm.
* Every Monday and Wednesday (excluding Ontario statutory holidays).

## Getting started
