# Today's Objective: Telling your story with data, using Google Charts

## Objective

Developers that can prove their ability to build data visualizations are highly prized in the job market. Graphs and charts are among the most common data visualization patterns that are presented to software developers to implement. 

But even more impressive is the ability to combine storytelling with data visualizations.

Today's objective is to create a chart-based website that will tell your own story in a beautiful graphical format.

## Requirements

Your goal is to tell a story using data. This sounds more scary than it actually is!

Take a look at [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery). All the hard work is done for you. All you have to do is build your story using data (or find data, then reshape it to match the story you are trying to tell).

The following graphs are particularly useful for telling stories:
* [Geo Chart](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/geochart) - you can talk about places you visited, where you've travelled to,
* [Org Chart](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/orgchart)

The most featureful and visually appealing story stands a chance of winning.

### Suggested Libraries

* [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery)

### Example

You can take a look at my own example here: https://codepen.io/monarchjhaveri/pen/YzydJeV

## Frameworks:

It is completely possible to build this using vanilla JS or jQuery. You can use React, Vue, Angular if you wish.

## Restrictions

* Your project must use JavaScript.

There are no other restrictions.

## Tips for success:

1. The project is intentionally simple so you can focus on code quality.
1. The requirements are intentionally minimalistic so you can get as creative as you'd like.
1. Making your project look nice will make it more appealing to employers!
